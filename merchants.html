                                <h3><strong>Steps to becoming a Mintows Merchant:Its a ONE STEP Process</strong></h3>

less than 2 minutes. <strong>Registration is free.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>What's Next?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>You are ON.....in 5, 4, 3......</strong></p>
<ul class="arrowList">
                            	<li>Once you register you get 50,000 Purple Mintows coins FREE (a Value of $500). You

need to have Mintows in your account to Publish promos, messages and deals.

A welcome gift for joining the Mintows family and to help you get started.</li>
                                <li>When customers visit you and make a purchase you give away your Purple Mintows to

them. How many, you may ask. Well that depends on you; you set the rules.</li>
                                <li><strong>After a customer has collected a fistful of Purple Mintows, they come back to you to

redeem their Mintows for a small gift. You reward your customer for being loyal, and the

customer turns into a happy shopper.</strong>

How many coins do you have to redeem and for what gift? Again, its your business, so your rules. You can

set a minimum number of Mintows the customer must accumulate before they can redeem. You can also set a

rule where they can only redeem cubbed with the next puchase, it all depends on how you set the rules.</li>
                                <li>You can always top up the number of your Mintows in your account by a quick online

purchase at our secure site. Choose from a number of attractive offers, and tailor your

Customer Relationship Initiative according to your needs.</li>
                            </ul>
       <h3><strong>How it works Under the Hood:</strong></h3>  
       
       <ul class="arrowList">
                            	<li>You publish Promos, Deals & Steals, Messages, which Happy Shoppers can see on their

mobile devices when they are within a certain distance from your location.

More ....Depending on the city, traffic conditions, time of day and a number of other factors, Mintows

intelligently calculates a radius with the user at the centre, and displays information that nearby Merchants

have published,</li>
                                <li>Happy Shoppers also receive <strong>Push Notifications</strong> when they are not actively on Mintows.</li>
                                <li>Happy Shoppers who are not in your vicinity get updates on your deals when they are at

their home, or work place.</li>
                                <li>Of course Shoppers can search for merchants or promos from anywhere, with key words.

More....For eg. They can search for “Buy one Get One, in Arizona”, or “Coffee shops in Bukit Bintang”and

if your promo matches the search conditions, your business will come up in the listings. One may ask, why

would anyone search for coffee shop, rather than simply walk into one...its a very valid thought. However

experience shows that customers like to collect Mintows, so for a Mintows Happy Shopper, if there is a

Mintows merchant coffee shop nearby, they prefer to go there rather than anywhere else.</li>
<li>Each Mintows Happy Shopper has a unique Account Linked QR code. You can scan this

with any internet connected mobile device to quickly and easily exchange Mintows to and

from the customer.</li>
<li>Once someone shops at your establishment, you transfer Mintows to your customer by

scanning the QR code with your Android device and entering the transaction amount. If

you'd like to do it using a computer, or simply any browser, you can just enter the

customer's email id, after logging in to your account.</li>
<li>When the customer wants to redeem, you scan again, but zapping customers' Mintows,

and giving them a little gift in exchange. This is what creates Happy Shoppers and they

become your permanent customers.</li>
                            </ul> 
                            
     <h3><strong>Getting featured on the Premium Display Panel on the customer's screen:</strong></h3> 
     <p>All you have to do to get featured on the Premium Display Panel, is to be one of the Top Ten

spenders (giver of Mintows to customers) of Mintows in a day, in your city. The Top Ten is

ranked every day at 12 noon.</p>
                                        
   <h3><strong>Benefits of Being a Mintows Merchant</strong></h3>
   <p>Have you ever come across anyone who gets excited about watching advertisements on TV during

a football match? Do we even remember any of the full page adverts we see in newspapers after 15

minutes? What's the recall value of these advertisements? Close to Zero.</p>  
<p>Traditional advertisement on traditional media costs a bomb, their effectiveness is not measurable,

and you still have to pay whether or not your campaign generates actual sales. Traditional media is

undemocratic, its an exclusive club of big businesses.</p>  

<p>Mintows lets you be with the customer all the time. You reward your customers with a miniscule

portion of your ad budget, and keep them:</p> 

<ul class="arrowList">
<li>coming back,</li>
<li>buying from you instead of others</li>
<li>buying in bigger quantities</li>
<li>buying things that they otherwise wouldn't have bought</li>
<li>interested in your business by continuous engagement</li>
<li>sharing their great experiences with their friends & family</li>
<li>Spreading the word about you to new people like a virus</li>
<li>Rating your business favourably to encourage others to buy from
you.</li>
</ul> 

<p>Mintows speaks to the buyer at the moment of truth, when the customer is about to pull out

the money and make a purchase. Mintows brings the customer into your store and

influences the buying decision at the moment of purchase. One can not forget a message

received on Mintows, because its there with the customer, in his favourite device, personal,

omnipresent and omnipotent.</p> 
<p>Mintows is FREE to get started on. We even give you $500 worth of coins to let you

TEST DRIVE Mintows. You spend your ad budget on your customers, to keep them

happy, the pople who are your buyers, the ones who matter to your business, and make it

thrive, instead of having to spending many times more to pay TV channels or large media

houses to just carry your message.</p>  
<p>We send you regular reports so that you can see how many customers you have got because of

Mintows, and what amount of Sales you have generated of what items by joining the program.

You know who has bought what and how often. You can tailor your offerings to suit every

customer likewise.</p> 
<p>Whether you are a ginormous corporation or a small street corner eatery, you have equal

opportunity on Mintows. We bring democracy to businesses reaching out to customers.</p>
<p>Mintows helps you bring back customers you were losing to online merchants. Mintows users post

their experiences on social media, so you get benefited as the users' spread the word about you at

no extra cost to you. You already know that nothing works better then personal recommendation

and word of mouth, and Mintows gets the users talking, and while at it, they might be

recommending you to their friends.</p> 

<p>Mintows cuts your cost of doing business, and adds to your bottom line.</p> 
<p>At this point, what if I told you, that I can guarantee an increase in sales, at no extra cost for

advertisement, would that appeal to you?</p> 
<p>You don't need any special equipment, just an Internet connected smart phone, at the point of sale,
and the will to join and see your business grow and thrive.</p>  

<h3><strong>So is Mintows an Advertising medium or a loyalty program?</strong></h3>
<p>Mintows is a little bit of many things, but we call it a unique Customer Relationship Initiative. But

an annoying advertisement medium it is not. Mintows brings customers information they are

looking for , when they are looking for it. Its a never before thought of way of engaging with

customers harnessing the power of technology. Technology that is personal, always on, and

growing in reach.</p>

                                    <p>Its hard to compare Apples and Oranges, but let me try. Groupon works on a system of

volume discounts given to a group of buyers all of who must go for a particular deal at a

particular time. If a minimum number of buyers don't take the deal, then the deal is off.

Groupon is visual centric, designed to appeal to buyers' impulses.

Mintows works on a system of building long term relationships with customers, which we

call the Customer Relationship Initiative or CRI. This results in greater volume of sales to a

single person over a long time. Many such single persons add up to generate a large volume

of consistent sales over a period of time, than one flash deal at one point of time. Mintows

is technology centric, designed to be a continuous bridge between the customers and the

merchants, which develops into a very personal realtionship.</p>

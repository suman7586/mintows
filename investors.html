                        <h3>Investors:</h3>

<p>If investing in Mintows interests you, please mail us at info@mintows.com, We like to hear from

like minded people who have developed an emotional bond with our idea and would like to be part

of the Mintows growth story.</p>

<h3>Is Mintows interested in investment?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only from the right kind of investor. An investor who shares our vision and mission and

understands that the product has been designed and built with a certain mindset; who understands

and subscribes to the underlying thought (although we are open to great ideas that would push the

growth of Mintows), as it is critical to the success and growth of Mintows.</p>

<h3>Is Mintows a wise investment?</h3>

<p>Well, we certainly think so, as obviously we have invested in the idea and its development. So

what does it hold for investors from the outside, like Angels, or Venture Capital funds?</p>

<p>Are we only looking at Angels and VC funding? We are looking for the perfect partners, whether

they are individuals, VCs, Angels, or groups.</p>

<p>Mintows has a robust revenue model. However, there are certain realities of the technology

business that we have to work within. Technology costs a lot to develop and operate. Yet for the

users its got to be a free or almost free service.</p>

<p>Consumers are used to getting information over the internet for free. This is the beauty of

technology and the Internet. It democratizes the market. It empowers ordinary people. Reaching

millions of people suddenly becomes affordable. We are completely enamoured with this idea of

technology bringing democracy and empowerment.</p>

<p>But, how does an investor get returns in this Free economy environment?</p>

<p>Mintows doesn't play ads that users do not want to see, its a unique customer relationship

initiative. Mintows promotes businesses that are relevant to a user's location and interests. Users

actively seek information and are on the verge of buying something from these Mintows

Merchants. This is tangible, recorded and documented and most importantly – billable.</p>

<p>Mintows runs myriad activities through the app, which has a revenue stream of its own. Mintows

has a separate business model for redemption of Gold Mintows, which are another source of

revenue for Mintows.</p>

<p>Mintows has several independent revenue channels, which add up to substantial numbers.</p>

<h3>Why does Mintows need investment?</h3>

<p>Mintows needs investment for growing its reach in the market, for spreading its footprint to

different markets around the world, for scaling up its services and assets in order to provide better

and more optimal service to its users.</p>

<h3>What is the main objective of Mintows?</h3>

<p>We have designed and created Mintows with the intention of improving the lives of people from a

(certain angle of course), and we have to stay in the market to continue to achieve that objective.</p>

<p>What Mintows can most likely do for the investor is grow a larger footprint for itself and thereby

multiply revenues many many times over. There is no geographical limit, nor any operating hours.So Mintows keep earning 24/7 x 365 days a year. One can imagine a situation where the Sun doesn't set on Mintows.</p>

<p>We do not expect Mintows to bring a windfall for the investors, but it can be a sound long term

investment where sustainable revenues are created over a period of time.</p>

<h3>How much investment is required and why?</h3>

<p>Mintows requires investment for growth, expansion, and market penetration in different tranches.

At this stage we are looking for an amount that will help us achieve these objectives in the near

term of 2­3 years. We are open to discussing numbers, as how well we can achieve the objectives

during this term are defined by how much funds are available.</p>

<h3>What is special about Mintows?</h3>

<p>Mintows operates in medium to large markets. It also operates in markets of varied maturity,

which insulates Mintows from market shocks. Mintows works on the philosophy that if something

adds value to people's lives, they will be happy to share their lives with it. Sharing the lives of

hundreds of thousands of people gives Mintows a veritable insight into a large cross section of the

society in all the markets where it operates.</p>

<p>Mintows understands that in order to provide free or almost free services, and still generate

substantial revenues which churn a profit, it needs to operate out of low cost centres. Yet being

online in the internet and cloud space, we can deliver services worldwide just as effectively as

anyone else. What that means for the investor is more bang for the same buck.</p>

<p>Let's discuss your interest further – drop us a mail at <a href="mailto:info@mintows.com">info@mintows.com,</a> with a brief background

of yourself, past experience in investing in tech products or the lack of it, what interests you in

Mintows and what you expect to see in terms of our future together. We are open minded folks,

but are chasing after a very specific target, that is to make Mintows a global tech brand with a

robust business base.</p>
